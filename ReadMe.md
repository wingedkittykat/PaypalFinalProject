# **HENKAN**
A recycling initiative
- - - -

## Motivation Behind the Company

Henkan is a venture that aims to reduce the impact of consumerism on the environment through its campaign to reuse and recycle. One of the most wasteful markets in the world is the fabric industry. Dozens of clothes are manufactured and sold every day into households that have no particular need for them. This leads to a tremendous amount
of waste generation not to mention squandering of resources. This is where the company steps in to try and salvage the resources that are under-utilized and exploit them to their maximum potential.

## User Profiles

Henkan caters to three types of user profiles:

- ### Donors
  Donors are the people who have excess clothes in their homes and wish to get rid of them. Say clothes that they have outgrown, clothes that are worn, clothes they are tired of, clothes that need mending etc. These types of users are the ones that provide the raw material inventory needed for our products

- ### Creators
  Creators are the ones who tranform the donations into new and trendier products. They may be trained proffesionals such as tailors or fashion designers, or even stay at home moms looking for a hobby. These profiles are both consumers and producers of the company. They consume the donations from the donors and produce creations that are again put up for sale. 

- ### Users
  These are the most numerous profiles. The ones of the buyers. These profiles can view and consume either the secondhand donations marked as reusable directly, or the unique creations.

## Products

There are two types of end products in the system

- ### Creations
  These can be anything from new clothes made out of old, purses, curtains, bedspreads, placemats, scarves, handkercheifs etc. They can include anything that can be made from the old clothes put up as donations from the artists. 

- ### Secondhand Donations
  These are the clothes that do not have much wear and tear to them and are put up as donations tagged ReuseableAsIs. These can be bought and used directly by the users.

The donations tagged NeedMending or UseForScraps are an intermediate product that are bought by creators and then turned into creations.
